# ðŸ§  Local Single AI Agent with Integrated RAG  

This repository hosts a **local AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that runs entirely on your machine. It is a **single-agent AI** that retrieves information from indexed documents and enhances responses using a locally running **LLM (Llama3.2 or DeepSeek) with Nomic-Embed-Text** for embedding generation.

## ðŸ›  System Requirements  

To run the **Local AI Agent with RAG**, your system should have:  

- **Minimum VRAM:** **8GB** (Dedicated GPU recommended)  
- **Supported GPUs:** NVIDIA RTX 2070 or higher (CUDA enabled)  
- **CPU:** At least **6-core** processor for smooth inference  
- **RAM:** **16GB+** recommended for processing large documents  
- **Storage:** Sufficient space for storing indexed documents and embeddings

## ðŸŽ¨ Graph Visualization  

The app generates a **graph-based visualization** of indexed documents and chunks.  

ðŸ”¹ **Documents** are represented as **blue nodes**  
ðŸ”¹ **Chunks** are **green nodes**, connected to their respective documents  
ðŸ”¹ **Similarity edges** are drawn between related chunks  

### How to View the Graph?  

1. Run `app.py` and use the sidebar option **Visualize Graph RAG**  
2. The HTML file `graph.html` will be generated  
3. Open `graph.html` separately in a browser  

> **Note:** Uncomment and modify `app.py` as needed to enhance the visualization.

## ðŸ”§ Enhancements & Customization  

- Adjust document **chunking strategy** in `chunking.py`  
- Modify **retrieval strategy** in `index.py`  
- Extend **graph visualization** in `app.py`  

This project is fully customizableâ€”build your own **private local AI agent** using RAG! ðŸš€
